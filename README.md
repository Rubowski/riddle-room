# Mystery of the Four Rooms (Riddle Room Game)

A web-based puzzle where you solve riddles, collect magical items, and escape the mysterious rooms! This game is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features interactive gameplay, sound effects, and a modern, responsive design. This was created as a student project and is something I would like to expand upon. It's very simple in its current state. So, I would currently label it as a "Work in Progress".
